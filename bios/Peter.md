I started programming back in high school when I decided to teach myself Perl. During that period of time, my high school did not have very many computer based classes, therefore in order to expand my knowledge I had to teach myself most of what I know today. It started out with Perl and then I moved on to scripting basic computer actions. For any repetitive task that took longer than a minute, there was probably a script on my computer that performed exactly that task. And then from scripting I transitioned to Web development, experimenting with AJAX back when jQuery was still in its infancy and XMLHttpRequest was the primary method of creating asynchronous requests.

I have spent the past two summers at an internship at eBay, which Business Insider has listed as No. 3 in the best internships in technology, and will be looking forward to a third year there. I hope to eventually start a FTE position there working as a.NET application developer.
