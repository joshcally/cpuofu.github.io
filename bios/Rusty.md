I'm a junior in computer engineering. I'm a member of senior council of ASUU where I help plan and organize campus traditions and activities. I'm also a career ambassador where I help present workshops and help other students to improve their professional skills. I'm involved in LDSSA where I attend weekly religious education and other activities. I also teach a weekly Sunday school class to a group of over 50 peers. I participate in intramural sports as well as pick up games. I attend many Utah athletics events and I love to play games with my friends and go to movies.
