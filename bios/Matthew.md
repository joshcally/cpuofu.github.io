I have been programming computers since 4th grade. In 8th grade I started working with robots, and I was part of FIRST FRC Team 2484 during high school; I am now a programming mentor for that team.

Some of my hobbies are making video games, working with 3D printers, and learning new languages.

I love solving problems and undertaking ambitious projects. I have several projects that I work on throughout the year, most of which are released under the MIT license so that others can use them.

My goal is to make emerging technologies available to everybody.
