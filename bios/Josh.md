Born and raised in Salt Lake City, I have a growing interest in the many software companies opening shop in the area.  My fascination for computer science sprouts from the thrill of solving difficult programs and understanding what computers are capable of.  I find it refreshing to be a part of an industry that is constantly changing and improving.  From my internship at Spillman as a member of their DevOps team, I aim to become a full-stack developer over time and would love to continue to explore my career options.  Outside of coding, I enjoy various outdoor recreational activities along the Wasatch Front including snowboarding, mountain biking, and backpacking.  I also enjoy being a part of the U of U campus community as a leader in two different student groups, CPU of U and LDSSA.
