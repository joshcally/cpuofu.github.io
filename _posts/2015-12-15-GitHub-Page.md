Create your own splash page for free using your GitHub account.

If you don't have a GitHub account, get one. It helps employers see what kind of projects you are involved in and how you code.

Setting up your own website can be an easy and effective way to showcase your abilities and resume.

Follow the steps [this link](https://pages.github.com/) to set up your page once your GitHub account is set up.

This website itself is hosted on the team's GitHub page and is using Jekyll. There is a link on GitHub's official page on how to set up Jekyll for your site, but it is much easier to use [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to avoid having to install ruby and other things. Just follow the steps in the README on the jekyll-now repository page.
